6. (Practice) In 1627, Manhattan Island was sold to Dutch settlers for approximately $24. If the
proceeds of that sale had been deposited in a Dutch bank paying 5% interest, compounded
annually, what would the principal balance be at the end of 2012? The following display is
required; xxxxxx is the amount calculated by the program:
Balance as of December 31,2012 is:xxxxxx

7. (Practice) A C++ program is required that calculates and displays the weekly gross pay and
net pay of two employees. The first employee is paid an hourly rate of $16.43, and the second
is paid an hourly rate of $12.67. Both employees have 20% of their gross pay withheld for
income tax, and both pay 2% of their gross pay, before taxes, for medical benefits.
a. For this programming problem, how many outputs are required?
two ouputs are required
b. How many inputs does this problem have?
four inputs are required
c. Write an algorithm for converting the input items into output items.
gross pay = hours woked x rate
((hours worked x rate ) *.20)+((hours worked x rate) *.02) + gross pay = net pay
d. Test the algorithm written for Exercise 7c, using the following sample data: The first
employee works 40 hours during the week, and the second employee works 35 hours.
((40 * 16.43 )*.20)+(( 40 * 16.43)*.02)+(40*16.43) = 801.78
Second employee = 541.01
