5. (Desk check) List the elements displayed by the following sections of code:
a. for (m = 1; m <= 5; m++)
    cout << a[m] << “ “;
    -858993460 times five
b. for (k = 1; k <= 5; k = k + 2)
    cout <<  a[k] << “ “;
    -858993460 times three
c. for (j = 3; j <= 10; j++)
    cout << b[j] << “ “;
    -858993460 times seven
d. for (k = 3; k <= 12; k = k + 3)
    cout << b[k] << “ “;
    -858993460 times three
e. for (i = 2; i < 11; i = i + 2)
    cout << c[i] << “ “;
    -858993460 times five
