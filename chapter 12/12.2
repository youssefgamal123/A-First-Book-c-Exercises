1) done .
2) static binding : means that the determination of which function will be used from base class or derived class is done during compile time
  dynamic binding : means that the determination of which function will be used either from base class or dervied class is done during runtime and the function that will be used is determined by the programmer

3) virtual function helps in dynamic binding as typing virtual before the function name helps in determining the function that will be used during the run time
  non-virtual function will be determined automatically during compile time as it falls under the concept of "static binding "


4) polymorphism is the process of overriding a function in the base class to be used in the dervied class but in doing diffrent operation
An example of polymorphic behavior is any base class object that values are changed when called using the derived class object.

5) Virtual functions tells the compiler to create a pointer to a function.
Operator overloading is the overloading of the default operator.

6)
It is an example of overloading where the given function is assigned an operator in order to modify the resulting answer.
