10. (Modify) a. Modify the class written for Exercise 9a to include the grade of gas. Assume there
are three grades of gas: 87 octane, 93 octane, and 97 octane.

Done!!

b. Include the class written for Exercise 10a in a program that simulates the arrival of 10 customers
(using a while loop). The arrival time, number of gallons of gas each customer
requests, and octane rating of the gas should be displayed. After the last customer, your
program should display the total number of gallons requested for each grade of gas.

using namespace std;
// Customer class
// precondition:
// srand() must be called once before the flip()method is called
// class declaration section
class Customer
{

	//none
public:
	Customer() { cout << "\n**** A new Customer object has been created ****" << endl; };
	~Customer() { cout << "\n!!!!This Customer object has been deleted !!!!\n"<< endl; };
	void arrgas();
};

{

	int arrival, gas,gas1 = 0,gas2 = 0,gas3 = 0, gas_grade, total = 0, number = 0;
	while (number <= 10){

		arrival = rand() % 15 + 1;
		cout << "Arrival Times " << arrival << endl;
		gas = rand() % 15 + 3;
		if (gas >= 3 && gas <= 8){
		    gas_grade = 87;
			gas1 =+ gas1 + gas;
		}
		if (gas >= 9 && gas <= 11){
			gas_grade = 93;
			gas2 =+ gas2 + gas;
		}
		if (gas >= 12 && gas <= 15){
			gas_grade = 97;
			gas3 =+ gas3 + gas;
		}
		cout << "Gas Requested " << gas << " gallons of grade " << gas_grade << endl;
		total = +total + gas;

		if (number < 10){
		cout << "Next Customer!!" << endl;
	}
	number++;
}
	cout << "The total amount of gas bought was " << total << endl;
	cout << "The total at grade 87 was " << gas1 << endl;
	cout << "The total at grade 93 was " << gas2 << endl;
	cout << "The total at grade 97 was " << gas3 << endl;
	return;
}

int main()
{
		Customer *anewCustomer;  // declare a pointer to a Customer object

			    anewCustomer = new Customer; // create a new Customer object
				anewCustomer->arrgas();    // flip the Customer
				delete anewCustomer;     // delete the object

		system("PAUSE");
		return 0;
}

c. What does your simulation assume about the comparative desirability of each grade of gas?
Is this assumption realistic?

My simulation assumes that the 97 grade had the most gallons bought. The assumption is random and therefore realistic.

d. Based on your answer to Exercise 10c, what are the implications of using the simulation to
determine how much of each grade of gas to supply to a gas station?

A random selection of gas is not a valid database of customer habits. Therefore using this simulation in real life would be careless and costly.
