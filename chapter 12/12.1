rotected access behaves the same as private access, in that it permits access only to
member or friend functions, but it allows any derived class to inherit this restriction. The
derived class then defines the type of inheritance it’s willing to take on, subject to the base
class’s access restrictions. This definition is done by the class access specifier, which is listed
after the colon at the start of the class declaration section.
