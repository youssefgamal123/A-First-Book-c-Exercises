6. (Modify) Modify the main() function in Program 10.6 to use a while loop that calls the
Elevator’s request() method with a random number between 1 and 15. If the random
number is the same as the elevator’s current floor, generate another request. The while loop
should terminate after five valid requests have been made and be satisfied by movement of
the elevator. (Hint: Review Section 6.8 about the use of random numbers.)

int main()
{
	Elevator a, b(2, 5, 20);   // declare 1 object of type Elevator

	int total = 0;

	while (total < 5)
	{
		double var = rand() % 15 + 1;
	    b.request(var);
	if (var == var){
		b.request(var);
	}
	total++;
    }
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
