5. (Modify) a. Modify the main() function in Program 10.6 to put a second elevator in service
starting at the 5th floor and have a maximum floor of 20. Have this second elevator move to
the 1st floor and then move to the 12th floor.

int main()
{
	Elevator a,b(2,5,20);   // declare 1 object of type Elevator
	a.request(6);
	a.request(3);

	b.request(1);
	b.request(12);

	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

b. Verify that the constructor is called by adding a message in it thatâ€™s displayed each time a
new object is created. Run your program to verify its operation.

Elevator::Elevator(int idnum, int cfloor, int maxfloor)
{
	elNum = idnum;
	currentFloor = cfloor;
	highestFloor = maxfloor;

	cout << "Called Verified" << endl;
}
