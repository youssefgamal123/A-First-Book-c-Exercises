1. (Practice) Figure 10.3 is a simplified diagram for assembling a birdhouse. Referring to this
diagram, create a parts list and instructions for constructing it.
*See textbook for Figure 10.3 Building a birdhouse*

*Parts
-Roof Parts
2 rectangle pieces of wood with 4 screw holes each
2 triangle pieces of wood with one having a hole in it
-House Parts
3 rectangle pieces of wood
2 square pieces of wood with 4 screw holes each
1 peg
*Instructions
Place part D on the bottom
Connect A & B to the base D
Next attach both C's to each side
Attach the peg to A
Next attach E to (G & H) and F to (G& H) via screw holes
Finally attach the roof to the house and place the peg and hole on the same side.

2. (Practice) a. List the items you need to build a staircase with five steps.

10 rectangular pieces of wood
Hammer
Nails
2 support pieces of ply wood

b. Write instructions for assembling the items listed in Exercise 2a.

Connect each rectangular pieces of wood with nails using hammer.
Connect the peices into a row or right angles.
Cut the supporting pieces of wood in order to mach the dimension of the row of right angles.
Finally, connect each cut side to the rows or right angled pieces of wood.

3. (Practice) a. List the ingredients you need to create 10 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

Peanut butter
Jelly
20 slices of bread

b. Write instructions for assembling the items listed in Exercise 3a.

Spread peanut butter on 10 slices of bread
Spread Jelly on 10 slices of bread
Combine each peanut butter slice with a jelly slice

4. (Practice) Find assembly instructions from a recent item you have built (for example, a bicycle
or a bookcase with one shelf). Identify the major elements in the assembly instructions that
correspond to the Ingredients and Method of Preparation sections shown in Figure 10.2.

The instructions used to build a bookcase use use the same formula as the section shown in Figure 10.2
It gives the user a set of requirement and the arrangment of those requirements
